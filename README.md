* As the graphs above illustrate, films produced by BV studios generated the most amount of revenue, followed by Sony, and Universal. Domestic and international gross revenue showed little to no difference.

* As shown in the graphs above, the month of May performed the best when analyzing the highest amount of revenue earned. Not far behind were June and July. This may be the result of people being outside more enjoying the warmer weather and also wanting to be in an air-conditioned theater while watching a movie.


## Limitations:

* Missing data(NaN values and zero values)
* Data not up-to-date.


## Recommendations:

* Invest in Action and Adventure films; alternatively, Comedy films performed well and should be considered.

* Based on the success of the film production studios, there should be an emphasis on hiring people currently with BV, Sony, and/or Universal; primary focus should be on people from BV.

* Adequately finance production budgets in order to successfully create high-grossing films.

* Warmer weather leads to an increase in movie attendance. Therefore, the best months to release films are May, June and July.
