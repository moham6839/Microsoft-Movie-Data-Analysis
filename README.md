# Microsoft Film Production Analysis


### By Mohamed Hassan



## Objective:

To pinpoint the factors that should be considered when producing films, including:

* film genres which have produced the greatest revenue domestically and internationally. 
* film production studios that have generated the most revenue.
* production budget totals which resulted in the highest-grossing films.
* the months of film releases that performed the best.



## Data Sources :

* Box Office Mojo
* The Numbers
* Rotten Tomatoes


## Which film genres generated the highest revenue gross?



* Based on the graph above, Action and Adventure films achieved the highest amount of revenue, followed by Comedy.


## Highest-Grossing Film Studios:



* As the graphs above illustrate, films produced by BV studios generated the most amount of revenue, followed by Sony, and Universal. Domestic and international gross revenue showed little to no difference.


## What amount of financing in production budgets produced the highest amount of earnings?


* There was a strong correlation with production budgets and revenue earnings. There was little to no difference in domestic and international gross revenue.



## What month of the year generated the most revenue?

* As shown in the graph above, the month of May performed the best when analyzing the highest amount of revenue earned. Not far behind were June and July. This may be the result of people being outside more enjoying the warmer weather and also wanting to be in an air-conditioned theater while watching a movie.


## Limitations:

* Missing data(NaN values and zero values)
* Data not up-to-date.


## Recommendations:

* Invest in Action and Adventure films; alternatively, Comedy films performed well and should be considered.

* Based on the success of the film production studios, there should be an emphasis on hiring people currently with BV, Sony, and/or Universal; primary focus should be on people from BV.

* Adequately finance production budgets in order to successfully create high-grossing films.

* Warmer weather leads to an increase in movie attendance. Therefore, the best months to release films are May, June and July.
